      <p id="Carolyn-Tinky-Hoagland">Hello!!
        I’m Carolyn AKA Tinky. My husband and I own Pixie Dusted Memories Travel. I’ve been selling travel for about 10
        years now. I love all things Disney and have been to Disneyland at least a thousand times, WDW several times,
        and have done 10 Disney Cruises!
        Back in 2005 I planned a trip to WDW and a Cruise on the Disney Magic for my family of 15. We had multiple
        people with various disabilities from mobility, diabetes, ADHD, Sleep Apnea, Dementia, Food Allergies, along
        with Vision and Hearing loss. The AAA agent we were working with was not helpful with figuring out what we
        needed for those with special needs! Her response was to tell me to, “Call Disney or search the website.” I
        learned a lot about traveling with disabilities and from then on often reach out to help others trying to travel
        with disabilities. I told myself if I ever became a Travel Agent, I would pay special attention to those with
        disabilities. Over the years I’ve helped those with all kinds of disabilities travel and I’m here to help many
        more.</p>

      <p id="Aaron-Socher">I grew up going to Disneyland once a year. I got my first pass to the park in 2016 and
        started to deep dive into the history of the park and all that has changed. There was a felling I had when I
        went when I was younger that I have still yet to place or identify. I have yet to go to Walt Disney World but I
        enjoy learning everything about the park.
        I have traveled to a few locations in the US including; New York, Maine, Massachusetts, Washington, DC,
        Virginia, Wisconsin, Chicago, Cincinnati, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Denver CO. I have also visited some
        National Parks including, Yosemite, Sequoia, Death Valley, Lassen Volcanic, Crater Lake, Grand Canyon, Zion,
        Bryce, Arches. I have been on multi-day whitewater rafting trips on the Rogue River OR, Green River UT, Dolores
        River CO. Outside the US I have been to Scotland, France, Spain, Canada and Mexico. I have also been on an
        Alaskan Cruise on board the Zuiderdam of Holland America line. I have also skied at Keystone CO, Mammoth
        Mountain CA, June Mountain CA, Big Bear CA, and mountain biked at Mammoth Mountain, Big Bear, Angeles National
        Forest, Northstar near Lake Tahoe, Telluride CO, and Durango CO.
        My hobbies current and past include listening to a variety of new music, watching all forms of auto racing, my
        favorite being Formula 1, exploring the history of locations I have visited, gardening, mountain biking.</p>
